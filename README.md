# Mine vs Rock Detection

## Project Overview

**Mine vs Rock Detection** is a machine learning-based project aimed at classifying geological sonar data to differentiate between mines and rocks. The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can help in resource extraction and improve safety during mining operations by identifying potential hazardous mines and non-hazardous rocks from sonar data.

## Key Features

- **Data Classification**: The model distinguishes between two categories in the dataset â€” mines and rocks.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built using Logistic Regression (with potential to extend to other algorithms like Random Forest or SVM).
- **Cross-validation**: Implemented cross-validation (Stratified KFold) to ensure the robustness of the model.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves high classification accuracy, enabling safer decision-making in resource extraction processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 61 columns:

- **Features**: 60 columns of sonar data (numerical values representing features of the sonar signals).
- **Label**: 1 (Rock) or 0 (Mine) based on the sonar signal classification.

The data is preprocessed to convert categorical labels (like 'R' for Rock and 'M' for Mine) into numerical values (1 for Rock and 0 for Mine).

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and handling.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn`: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations).

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
